                    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I am 22 years old student of informatics at University WSB Merito in Warsaw, currently rocking my second year. Having former IT education (I've completed middle school with specialization in IT, mostly computer networks), picking programming as a hobby was a nobrainer, but as all things in life happen, one thing lead to another and I fell in love with it.</p>
                    <p>Fascinated with AI/ML and logical side of programming, I've started learning python as I believed it was language that would quickly help me achieve my goals, which at the time were revolved about making small QoL robots and programs that would help me with daily chores.</p>
                    <p>Right now im focusing mostly on backend development of small apps/games/websites, I've also accomplished one freelance project of a website for accounting office made totally from scratch using HTML/CSS. There is still much I want to learn, and I'm eagerly pursuing knowledge every day.</p>
                    <p>Having said that, in my free time I also like to play on guitar or make YouTube shorts containing animal facts!</p>

                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    <p>Starting strictly with programming I am working on improving my skills in Django, as well as want to learn how to do machine learning and automate testing.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand I am growing my YouTube shorts chanel which is doing surprisingly well, and I am working on my guitar skills, hence I listen mostly to rock and metal I won't stop till I learn at least a few of major solos from these genres ;). </p>

                    <h2>My Career</h2>
                    <p>My career so far revolved around a few things, but mainly it was customer support and sales in which I have over a year of experience. I really enjoyed contact with customer and loved to solve their problems, which might tell you that I'm not afraid of social interactions and making friends. That doesn't mean that I can't do office work, last year was spent be me working in the accounting office, mostly as an accountant, but I had my fair share of more IT tasks that included making excel forms, connecting new devices to local network and most importantly making a website.</p>
